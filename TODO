CJK:
* 59-family-prefer-lang:
  + Google Noto embeds Adobe Source Sans Pro as Latin.
    but Google wants us to use Roboto/Noto Sans for Latin.
    the CJK prepend needs to prepend Roboto/Noto Sans/Serif
    too 
* Noto Sans CJK SC and Noto Sans SC are different font names
  (The later is a subset of the former). So we need to provide
  substitutes. ✓
* Adobe Souce Hans are the same as Google Noto Sans. we need
  to use Noto to provide Source Hans
* openSUSE should support colored emojis out of the box. We
  need to provide a 50-emoji.conf. ✓
* openSUSE should use modern symbol fonts like Deepin OpenSymbol
  which is 100% replacement for M$ Wingdings and Symbola ✓
* We need to re-evaluate the selections in 60-family-prefer.conf
  specially the CJK part. Most of the fonts listed there are
  pretty old and have modern replacement.
